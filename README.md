Framework
=========

A customizable CSS framework for scalable, robust, front-end development. This framework includes zero visual styling. It's all about reusability, accessibility, solid naming conventions and super fast performance. Created by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/colmtuite" target="_blank">Colm Tuite</a>.

Things to note
=========

- Zero visual style. Zilch. Nada. That's your job.
- Function is completely separated from form.
- Less than 10kb before gzip.

Naming
=========

- Component names should be in camelCase.
- Component modifiers should have two dashes. e.g. .componentName--modifier
- Component ancestors should have one dash. e.g. .componentName--ancestor
- Component states should be like .is-stateName e.g. .is-disabled
- JS hooks should be prefixed with "js-". e.g. .js-javascriptHook
